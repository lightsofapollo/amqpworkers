# AMQP Workers

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lightsofapollo/amqpworkers.png)](https://travis-ci.org/lightsofapollo/amqpworkers)

AMQP Workers is an opinioned library which codifies a lot of my personal
tastes while working with AMQP in JavaScript (node). It also embraces a
Promise _only_ api (everything should return a promise) and requires you
to setup / manage your own amqp connection (through [amqplib](https://npmjs.org/package/amqplib)).

The primary export is build out of four smaller modules (and while you
can use the top level export using the longer form is probably what you
want).
